Wordle expansion plans
What are we doing?
The plan is to create the variations of wordle and possibly other fun small games from the new york times minigames. I want to put all of this in one application and to log individual scores that may be pitted against other users. To bring out the competitive nature in people.

Why are we doing this?
This is obviously to strengthen my resume, but it’s also a passion that runs off my grade 12 addiction to new york time puzzles and wordles in my ICS class. It’s something that I’m actually interested in and that's what I need to fuel me when working on a project.

Which games will we include?
-Regular wordle
-Regular wordle (word length variations)
-Multiword wordles (Octordle, Quordle)
-Wordle but every time you get one right it adds a letter
-Wordle endless??
There’s many more that haven’t come to mind yet.

What will we use?
There are lots of questions about the architecture of this application. Is it going to be both a mobile and web application? What languages should we use? What backend database should we use?

Currently working on simply tranposing everything from HTML/CSS/JS to React/TSX.
Planning to implement other game modes before worrying about keeping data.
